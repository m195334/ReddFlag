Convert PDF ads to image

Make sure convert.sh is in a directory above the ads, therefore it
should be in the main directory that hass the reader and eveything else.

To run, do the following command

./convert.sh

If it does not run, do chmod +x convert.sh

Next, some ads without a 2nd page will create an empty .png file. in
order to remove them, run the program delEmpty.sh
"./delEmpty.sh". This removes all files with size 0 recursively.

The output should be a folder in YEAR_MONTH_img format. Inside, all
the Ads will be in .png format. The filename of the photo is
associated with the filename of the .pdf ad.
