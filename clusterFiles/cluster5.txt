A New Orleans judge ordered to release seven inmates awaiting trial because the Louisiana doesn't have money to defend them. Some of them have spent more than half a year awaiting a trial, but the city failed to provide the legal help to them. Each year the budget is shredding, but the Louisiana remains the state with the highest incarceration rate. Each year the system incarcerates thousands of black men and women for minor violations, but they let go the murderers and rapists. What is wrong with our country???
BLACK DOLLARS MATTER While Black activists are trying to strict American government's attention by organizing protests, Black bank owners urge Black Americans to transfer money into their banks. A few days ago there were started the #MoveYourMany campaign which the main goal is to demonstrate the value of Black lives within America. At the request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money into Black-owned banks in the last 5 days. 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds from non-Black banks to Black-owned institutions which would help to empower and advance Black community. The best way to fight the system is to break its capitalist back which is why it is important for Blacks to invest in ourselves!

FOOTBALL COACH SUSPENDED AND THE WHOLE SEASON CANCELED AFTER YOUNG ATHLETES TOOK A KNEE Young people continue to take a knee during a national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice in America. However, most of these athletes paid the price for this demonstration. For instance, on September 10, after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day, the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive board decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season and canceled the whole football season. So now we know what opposition might face in this country.

"First and foremost, we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists, but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful, still be self-made... Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love, Chicago. Sincerely, Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago, Illinois" It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back. It should work. As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love. That's cool that this love goes back and forth! We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some people forget how much love and care black people show.

We both fight the same system and we both will win in the future. Indigenous black civilisations of America and our civilisations were ruined by the same gabachos. And we both are growing in numbers, even whitewashed statistic, and officials prove it. Iowa Rep. Steve King said that "The United States is moving towards becoming, the whites becoming a minority, a majority- minority within the country." Also, he said that "Blacks and Hispanics will be fighting each other before overtaking whites in population", and this is exactly what authorities want. They will be ruling us while we would be too busy fighting each other! So, don't let this happen! Help black people in their struggle and let them help us!

She came through a lot and became a star. proving the very simple statement "If you want something; you can achieve it". Her success is important not only because she overcame her past and became successful, but also because she is making the statement to all the haters in this country. Black girls can do anything!

CHICAGO MAN SPENT 10 YEARS IN PRISON ON DRUG CHARGES BECAUSE COPS LIED UNDER OATH ABOUT THE CASE. Jermaine Walker was arrested and sent to prison after the police officers and a state's attorney investigator had LIED UNDER OATH. They said that there was no surveillance camera in the alley where they arrested him ; even though it was and Walker said that! It's another prove that if you are black in this country; you are never safe. You can be arrested killed or imprison literally for the color of your skin. Walker's attorney said that Walker can obtain up to $170,000 for the time he spent in prison, but is it a good price for the 10 years of his life?! These bastards ruined this man's life and proved once again that there is not justice in this country!

As we celebrate and reflect upon the birth of the great Martin Luther King Jr., a voice of the people and one who sacrificed his life for the total liberation of Black Americans, the question is ''who will keep his dream alive"? He saw the promise-land where blacks and whites live together in harmony and each of them given equal rights and privileges, freedom and justice. Today, we do not see this equality among blacks and whites in America. These rights and privileges; freedom and justice shouldn't be for some selected few but all!

Black kids suffer more than children of any other nation in America.

White media used to tell what is important for whites and cover facts important for Blacks.
Brendan Carter decided to pay a visit to his sick uncle and was held by officers in a public RTS bus station in Rochester, New York. Carter said he was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma, Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them. Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks. Very ridiculous.

Police Officer Robert Rialmo's attorney, Joel Brodsky, says that he will be filing a counterclaim against the estate of Quintonio LeGrier on the grounds of assault and emotional distress. This is how it looks like when A White Police kills a black Civiliian, and also feels it's his right to sue the dead because sympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops, then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of inhumanity. The cops still things it wasn't enough killing a mentally disordered and an innocent woman. He still has the balls to sue even the dead. This is what living in America is like, if you are black.

Do you know that the white Milwuakee officer who was fired from his job after fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black person's life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back — for the second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired. It is now absolutely clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

President Barack Obama signed a bill Friday eliminating the offensive and outdated descriptors, after the legislation passed unanimously in the House and Senate earlier this month. Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) sponsored the bill, which aimed to "modernize" two references to "Orientals" and "Negros" in the U.S. Code that date to the 1970's. The words will be replaced with "Asian Americans" and "African Americans," respectively. "The term `Oriental' has no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be gone for good," Meng said in a statement on Friday. Obama signed the bill shortly before leaving for his trip to Vietnam and Japan, where he will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima.

Don't believe the stereotypes that media created to discredit black dads! They're the best! Like if you agree!
A new report showed that West Virginia and 11 other states have to the highest percentage of children with a parent who is or was incarcerated. Can you believe these numbers? Of course, the highest incarceration level is among the black population of the country. The system is enslaving us with the help of the jails and it affects the whole community. Kids have to grow up not knowing their fathers and not having the support they need to make rights choices and school-to-prison pipeline doesn't leave them much of a choice. The kids grow up in extreme poverty without the access to the basic things like healthcare or education. The system is build to keep as many black people in the jails as possible. Being black in the US means being in a constant danger! You never know when you will be killed or sent to prison, because of the color of your skin. I've never heard white media talking about it, do you?
The statistics show that nationwide 15 percent of Black students receive suspensions, comparing with 4 percent of white students. In some state, the numbers are even more disturbing. For example, Wisconsin suspended 26.6 percent of Black students compared to the 3 percent of white students. Also in Minnesota, Connecticut, Iowa and Nebraska black students were six times more likely than white students to be suspended from school. The racism in education is the reason why the school-to-prison pipeline exists. Our kids cannot even get a proper education, no wonder the success rate among black students is low. Somehow white people still think that education is only their privilege.

There're a lot of racial discrimination going on in America these days. Can you imagine that a group of armed men took over a federal property and have vowed to kill if they are forced to leave there unless the government change the law in their favor. Nonsense! The ongoing Oregon standoff has taught us is that it's never been more apparent that the U.S. government values white lives above all others. The most stark example is comparing the kid-gloves treatment the white gunmen in Oregon are getting with the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house in Philadelphia. #GunmeninOregon #TheMove #1985Bombing

Man Dies After Police Use Pepper Spray During Arrest In Alabama A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper spray while arresting him after a chase, Tuscaloosa police said Saturday. Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's nose and throat. The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and body camera footage of the incident would be released after that investigation. This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever, but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this acceptable? We will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over. Let's wait and keep our eyes open. Black Lives Matter!
Black church vandalized for the third time in a row on Florida's Space Coast.Was it a hate-crime? A predominantly Melbourne black church was vandalized for the third time in six months. According to the Melbourne Police Department, the vandal bought axes to chop through access points to get in. Church Bishop Jacquelyn Gordon said that the church was in the process of development since they moved two years ago into 125,000 foot industrial complex. Moreover, the message "SS Charleston 2" was found on the car nearby the Church, which raised concerns about church security. SS Charleston 2 indicates the tragedy in Charleston when nine people were shot to death by white supremacist Dylann Roof at Emanuel AME church. Before, the church members found the words "We see u" that were painted in the radical emblem of the Nazi party swastika. How many hateful people living in America today? What of these people are getting their hatred and racism from their parents or friends? What if it is a hate crime? Has the government created a fund to assist this church?
Cleveland judge won't be forced to issue warrants in Rice shooting A divided Ohio appeals court panel on Friday said it would not force a municipal judge to issue arrest warrants for Cleveland police officers involved in the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a city park last November. Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank Garmback, to face charges in the shooting. Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a city recreation center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun. Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots pellets, died the next day. By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform... Let's honor Tamir's memory one more time.
'We want our chief back' Last week, in a place that bills itself as the "Friendliest Town on the Eastern Shore," angry residents marched to City Hall, demanding to give back a job for Kelvin Sewell, the community's first black police chief. On June 29 he was fired amid allegations leveled against white officers of departmental racism. After that the crowd of Sewell's supporters moved to voice their outrage to the Pocomoke City Council with posters that read "We Support Chief Kelvin Sewell." As a nation we have looked the other way for far too long and it is disgraceful! This time we're not fighting with police, we're fighting for justice. The system is broken, police doesn't protect us and the government cares only about tycoons' interests. So here's a question - who will care about Americans who can't protect themselves? Who will care about us? #JusticeforChiefSewell
Made In The US: The Justice Turns Into Business For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor charges in New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'cause they couldn't afford to pay bail. Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department, the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or disorderly conduct. The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what should we do? The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a business. The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government will start to sell indulgences soon. Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail! Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other Presidents administrations were brought to justice. America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping the very rich from ever being brought to justice.
KKK, African-American group plan rallies at South Carolina Capitol Could you please just close your eyes for a minute? Now, imagine... 70-years after the Third Reich was down, Berlin organizes Nazi military parade. Sounds weird; inconceivable right? So tell me, why KKK march at South Carolina Capitol draws the ire only of local African-Americans? A Ku Klux Klan chapter and an African-American group plan overlapping demonstrations on Saturday outside the South Carolina State House; where state officials removed the Confederate battle flag last week. We have been fought with slavery, Jim Crow laws and etc for REALLy long time so what's the problem today? Nothing good coming out of this mess. So what is the purpose of this march? Hmmm... It feels like this could be billed as "the fight of the century." What do you think about it guys?
I see racism as a pervasive element of both right and left wing politics in the US. Trust no one.
The Civil Rights Activist Mary McLeod Bethune Mary McLeod Bethune was the civil rights activist and an educator who found the National Council of Negro Women in 1935. Being one of the 17 children of former slaves she was the first and the only child to go to African-American school. She found the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls because she believed that education was the key to racial advancement. In addition
Man rammed St. Louis police car'for the black people'. Black people are fed up with an age of racist society? The 48-year-old Kevin Labriado from Bellefontaine Neighbors was charged for ramming police car from behind twice screaming "for black people". He assaulted two officers and his child who was sitting in his car. Two St. Louis officers were on patrol until Labriado and his five-year-old daughter accidentally rammed their car. When police officer tried to arrest him, Labriado yelled several times "This is for the black people". What if Labriado sought to revenge for all black lives that officers took away? Racism obviously gave rise to the tensions in society that led to disrespect and hate. Moreover, black people are fed up with racism and police violence towards black community. What is more, racial tensions have gotten worse under the current government. Even after several months of protests over the deaths of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland and Freddie Gray the government inspired more unrest. Today black community is in desperate situation seeking for help.
BREAKING NEWS!#Oakland #JoeBart Oakland police officers fatally shot a man suspected in alleged carjacking attempt in Downtown Oakland Wednesday night. Is it a race war? Yesterday night. a group of 50 protesters burned Confederate flag and tried to shutdown a freeway in Downtown Oakland. The opposition to police violence was in response to the police shooting earlier in the day. According to Oakland Police Department, yesterday at 2:39 p.m. in the area of 69th Avenue and International Boulevard. Oakland police officers spotted a vehicle they believe to be connected to a previous robbery on July 27. The pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. street. But when the suspect ran of the car, three officers opened fire. The suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital. Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers? How quickly it has become so usual? Why it has become so legit? Where is the government speaking about the existence of racism in America? Black Lives Matter!
Black people still face discrimination New data shows that white privilege still dominates in the United States of America. It is painfully obvious that unequal treatment is harmful on a daily basis. For instance, poor service plays an important role contributing to alteration in health that is potential harmful realities for many black people.
What is like to live in America if you are black? Well, first of all you have to work much harder to prove that you are worth others. Second of all, everybody is judging and stereotyping you by the color of your skin. Third of all, you are always being an `other" even in the country you were born. Forth of all you are always expected to be load and to dance well. In addition, there are lots of people who like to `throw race cards". Can we live like that? How long should we wait for the government contributions?

BREAKING NEWS! St. Louis police fatally shot a black teenager while trying to issue search warrant On Wednesday, Aug. 19 racial tensions again sparked in Missouri city after St. Louis police officers fatally shot black teenager at Walton Avenue and Page Boulevard while trying to issue search warrant. According to St. Louis Police Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the suspect four times were about seven years on the force. That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later on, nine people were arrested on charges of resisting arrest. The protesters said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if this situation makes us want to keep the police out of our neighborhood? Why do you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that the shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters who were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the city and the government needs to center its attention on racism and discrimination in America instead of suspecting every single black men? We cannot accept the fact that police can easily kill black people in America, than we must do something about it. Protest or accept it. You choose. This is your life.
What is like driving while black in America? Throughout the twenty-first century there are thousands of complaints of the police "profiling" black drivers in America. Black Americans often complaint about being pulled over for the phenomenon called "driving while black". For example, a rich African American driving new Ferrari can be stopped hundreds of times for no apparent reason just because the fact that a black man driving an expensive car attract the attention of the police officers. But what if racial profiling ends with lethal consequences? Do you remember Sandra Bland who had run-ins with the police while driving? Do you all remember that she was found dead in police custody? Do we all have to avoid traffic stops in order to survive? For the matter of fact, the routine traffic stops are being a big deal for the people of color. According to the Justice Department statistics, black drivers are about 31 percent more likely to be subject to police than whites. Overall, this number indicates the racial difference in America.
Silenced racism in America Tamir Rice, Rumain Brisbon, Kajieme Powel, Dante Parker, Michael Brown, John Crawford III, Eric Garner, Jonathan Ferrell, Kimani Gray, Michael Brown and Sandra Bland are one of many examples of excessive police brutality used on black Americans. You never know if a simple traffic stop will end up with you in a police custody or bullets in your chest. Unfortunately, many of Americans feel very uncomfortable talking about these issues, which seem to confirm the idea that the government remain silent. Nevertheless, one should accept that African-Americans are more likely to be targeted by police officers on the street than whites. Therefore it endangers the rights of black community. Doubtless when the government defends the officers who have killed black men, it strikes us how unfair the system is and reaffirms our view that America would spend billions of dollars on radical extremists than talking about the domestic terrorism, racial inequality and police brutality.
Confederate flags are permitted to fly at schools in Tennessee. Parents are worried about their children's safety. Yet here we are, Tennessee parents are worried about their children's safety at the local school after discovering that anyone is permitted to wear Confederate flag attire and to fly the Confederate flags at school. This provoked widespread discontent among black parents of Rutherford County. One of the parents said that she witnessed the students wearing the Confederate flag T-shirt and the controversial flags flying in the back students' cars. How would you feel if your child studies among those who like to fly the Confederate flags on their trucks? How would you feel about the safety of your child? Why children were permitted to openly display the Confederate flag on the school grounds? What kind of symbol the Confederate flag is for you? Do you remember Dylann Roof who killed black people at church? Do you remember that he was promoting the Confederate flag? What if your child studies among the same people? Is it an appropriate place for your kid to study? If Nazi flag was banned, than the Confederate flag must be outlawed too. Thus, if the government continues to accept this flag, it will bring more racist and hateful movements, because the Confederate flag shows a lack of empathy for African Americans slavery and for every black American man.
Love this sign because it's true. Whether killed or jailed, too many Black children lose their fathers because of corrupted system.
We do not want to fit into racist negative stereotypes that America has place on us. We are so tired of the government and media putting out the false images of black Americans. Why blacks are portrayed as brutal and aggressive? Can we stop it somehow?
Jamycheal Mitchell: Mentally III, Criminalized. and Killed by the System Stories like the one of Jamycheal Mitchell, the 24-year-old young man who was found dead in his jail cell on August 19, are particularly hard to hear. What the police ruled "natural causes" turned out to be that he starved to death. The crime? Shoplifting. Mitchell. who had a severe mental illness had been ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a zebra cake. a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth; Virginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge. A judge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been transported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there wasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in his cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a mental health facility. He had lost nearly 80 pounds because he refused to eat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health crisis. Yes; you can die over 5 dollars here in America. Nothing new here. Justice is just an empty word in this country. Be sure, you will never know the truth. We are far away from the truth.
All lives matter? All lives mattered during slavery too. All lives mattered during segregation too. All lives mattered during apartheid too. All lives always matter. But there are situations, where some lives are focused more on during that time. Not because they matter MORE, but because they're not put on an equal playing field, not treated the same way, and are treated like they're less/matter less.
Think about this for a second. My house is on fire with my entire family inside. I make it out and scream for help. My neighbor grabs the water hose and sprays his house which isn't on fire. Then tells me all houses matter.
Racism is still a stumbling block between black and white Americans.
Know your rights and your freedom The murders of Michael Brown, Tryvon Martin, Freddie Gray, Eric Gartner and other black victims have dramatized depth of racism in America society. They were young and Black- that was enough for police officers to decide that they looked suspicious. The police brutality has sparked the movement and has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government along with the law enforcement violate our rights through the illegal use of force and mass arrests in order to obstruct our free expression. Yes, standing up for your right to protest for the equality and justice is challenging, but it's worth discrimination and unfairness black civilians face everyday. Remember, knowing your rights can be the most powerful weapon you have against police abuse and brutality. The most famous civil rights activists represent a basic philosophy, known for their fight against injustice and lasting profound impact in the lives of African- Americans. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Mary McLeod Bethune, Rosa Parks changed our lives forever. But what changes have you made? Have you contributed to a greater equality? What are you doing to fight against injustice and racism? Have you ever protested in civil rights protests or have you ever been part of Black Lives Matter movement? How do your protect your right to free expression? Please comment below, what have YOU done to prove- BLACK LIVES MATTER?
What progress have we made towards eliminating racial profiling? Who is trying to damage the stereotypes of African Americans? How many black men have died for minor crimes at the hands of the police officers?

Moreover she claimed that she is "almost to the point" of defending the segregation. After her post about the recent pool party incident drew local attention, the teacher deleted her profile. "This makes me ANGRY! This officer should not have had to resign. I'm going to just go ahead and say it....the blacks are the ones causing the problems and this `racial tension. I guess that's what happens when you flunk out of school and have no education. I'm sure their parents are just as guilty for not knowing what their kids were doing; or knew it and didn't care," she wrote. She also added,"I'm almost to the point of wanting them all segregated on one side of town so they can hurt each other and leave the innocent people alone. Maybe the 50s and 60s were really on to something. Now, let the bashing of my true and honest opinion begin....GO!#imnotracist #imsickofthemcausingtrouble #itwasagatedcommunity". As we see Karen Fitzgibbons is a real racist, who approves the humiliation of black people! This news clearly reflects that American society is close to collapse, if not to say to war. As the authorities are doing nothing to resolve the situation, in the near future we may face real race war within our country.

"Free Figure's Black Power Rally at VCU:"
A woman pretended Afro-American to gain control over black community association The president of a local NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington is under investigation after her parents publicly accused her of lying being African American. Both parents of Rachel Dolezal are white. Rachel Dolezal also serves as the chair of Spokane's Office of Police Ombudsman Commission and is an adjunct professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington University. Dolezal falsely identified herself as African-American in order to be appointed as a chair. Dolezal's parents paid attention to the official documents, including a birth certificate, confirming that Rachel is part Swedish, Czech, and German with "traces" of Native American heritage. We see, how whites are trying to gain control over traditionally black organization that protects the rights and interests of the black community. In the Dolezal's case it is unlikely it was a mistake or personally motivated fraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community in order to control it and hold the interests of white majority. We need a deep inspection of Rachel Dolezal's activities while she was a president of the local branch of the Association of black people! In order not to repeat similar cases in future we need a careful control of all appointments by black community! As it is, there is a dominance of whites in police departments and authorities of cities with a predominantly black population!
2Pac believed in Fight Tupac Shakur was indeed not just one of the greatest rappers of all time but a worldly icon whose status in hip-hop culture can never be replaced. His revolutionary knowledge mixed with street experience made him powerful unstoppable force that spoke to the hearts of millions of people. His songs touch on a number of engaging topics, including religion, women, oppression, etc. 2Pac was a humanitarian, who stood up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. He believed in Fight and Speaking the Truth. Nowadays a lot of singers, both black and white use their music to sell records, just for making money. American society at all levels became too corruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary citizens. On the contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That's why he spoke to issues of poverty, oppression and racism. Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money, drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government's attitude towards Blacks. But let's remember Tupac and his ability to question the social order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to change their lifestyles for better society. He always asked people to share with each other and to learn to love each other.
It is an American history. African-American citizens sat behind signs like these on city buses.
Americans so much effort to hate each other instead of putting the effort into doing something useful. Stop racism! We all belong to ONE HUMAN RACE.
In early 1900s this Black Americana Chocolate Eyes Ad Art was popular in the USA. They made money from our pain and suffering! Though today we don't see such ads, racism still exists in the American society.
Rachel Dolezal is wearing the other persons shoes. Rachel Dolezal drew attention to her racial identification. A white-born former NAACP leader claimed to be black. The criticism towards Dolezal stems controversy around her identity and her position as the president of the NAACP in Washington. Today. Dolezal sees herself as first transracial. Rachel Dolezal stated that her racial identity was black, American Indian; white and two more races. Moreover if she proves that she is black; than anyone else will be able to prove that he/she is not even a human being. What do you think about her? What kind of rights should she have?
What else has to happen for you all to realize black lives matter?
Whatever the white man has done. Black Americans have done, and often even better. Miss Black America in 1969.
Black is beautiful. God knows what he is doing. The Black skin is a glorious symbol of national greatness.
A small group of activists burned two confederate flags in response to shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. Why the symbol of the pro-slavery rebellion is still flying on the ground of South Carolina? Why the symbol of white supremacy is still flying on the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia? Why the flag that represents the murder of blacks was not removed from the national statehouse? The confederate flag represents terrorism, reminding us about the slavery time, racism and people that were murdered in a hate-crime. Today, we ask to remove this symbol of racism that flies 120 miles away from the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. Yes, we must wipe off every single symbol of racism from the United States of America including the confederate flag, KKK and other racist organizations. We must give new names to the streets which were named after racist political figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to Andrew Jackson, Robert Lee, Benjamin Huger, James Longstreet who owned slaves on their farms. How can we ever expect to get the racist symbols removed until we show ourselves to be men the same as any other race of men?

Even kids realize that black lives matter. Why are adults so blind then? Racial inequality should be stopped by any means.
Don't tell us race isn't the issue. Don't tell us the system works. Stop being blind, people.

There are people who generally believe racism is over, but minorities believe that there's a lot of racial discrimination in the United States of America. Thousands of African Americans experience discrimination due to inequality which results cultural failure and racial pathology. Do you realize that racism sits at the very core of American thinking?
McKinney Police Officer Involved In Pool Party Incident Eric Casebolt, the McKinney, police officer who was caught on video pinning a teenage girl to the ground and pulling his gun on others at a pool party, has resigned Tuesday evening. The McKinney Police Department, Chief Of Police Greg Conley said that Casebolt's decision to leave was voluntary and that he would continue to collect a pension and benefits. Why are the police so aggressive? It's in every state around the country. The young girl at the pool party was treated horrible. Our society needs police, good police, people who will solve crimes but, unfortunately, today we need someone who will protect us from the police. At the same time, it is good that millions of regular people got a glimpse of what kind of policing minorities have endured for decades.

Police Charges Black Student For Driving To A Well-lit Area Last time I checked US wasn't involved in any wars or anti-terrorist operations, at least officially. Well, then how come Detroit is no less dangerous then (the city ranks third in the list of top 100 US most dangerous cities)?? When 24-year-old DaJuawn Wallace saw flashing blue police lights in his rearview mirror he chose to proceed with caution since some people are known to be robbed by fake police officers. He preferred to find a well-lit area to pull over in. As a result, he was charged with 'fleeing' police. People are terrified by the police to such a degree that they even prefer to communicate with officers only in the well-lit areas. And get charged for that. Sometimes it makes me actually think that when not involved in any military operations in the foreign countries, our country's at war with its own citizens with the help of police.

Cornel West on Obama:"The First Black President Has Become The First Niggerized Black President" Reacting to President Obama's use of the n-word on Marc Maron's podcast, Cornel West called him the first "niggerized" president in an appearance on CNN. West criticized Obama as "a person who is afraid and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy." "A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and fighting against white supremacy," West explained. "So when many of us said we have to fight against racism, what were we told?'No, he can't deal with racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president of all America, not just black America.' We know he's president of all America but white supremacy is American as cherry pie." West is right as usual. African minorities would choose Mr. West in 2009 and 2012 instead of Obama. But we had no choice. Cornel is a good leader, he knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The number is horrific.

Philosophy of African-American activist Huey Newton Huey Newton was an African-American political activist and a leader of generation of black, best known for founding the militant Black Panther Party in 1966. As a child, Newton experienced racial discrimination that influenced him to create the Black Panther Party as a voice of black people. His party grew up to a size of 5,000 full time party workers in 45 branches across America and inspired generation in North America to join the struggle against oppression. But he was shot to death in August 1989.

Marine veteran was forced by homeowner associations to remove USMC stickers from his car. Our country is run by idiots! Retired marine Frank Larison recently received a letter by the HOA, ordering him to remove his "marine stickers" from his Chevy car. Frank and his lawyer claim that he will face $50 a day if he refuses to do so. If he does not play those fines, he will be towed. Have you ever heard of someone receiving a notification to remove Obama stickers? LGBT stickers? Those terrorists Black Lives Matter stickers? Well, me neither! The liberal rage comes only to those who love the Old Glory or U.S. Armed Forces. Our whole society is ill. Libtards are allowed to do whatever they want while even the smallest demonstration of love and devotion to America causes an immediate intervention from the authorities.
The spread of hatred in the American society On Saturday there were two protests: a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina and an anti-racism protest. About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina's statehouse. Some of them present the KKK's rally against the removal of the Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag. It is a very clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races. The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we should clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn't refuse our history and our traditions.
Republican strategist Karl Rove said on "Fox News Sunday" the only way to stop gun-related violence, like the Wednesday massacre at Emmanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston S.C., was to repeal American citizens' Second Amendment rights. It's strange to hear it from the man who supported 2nd amendment earlier. The lack of clear-cut opinion is very bad character trait. However, it doesn't matter. The right to bear arms is inalienable right of Americans that was given us by the Founding Fathers. The 2nd amendment guarantees private safety of the people. The right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as existing prior even to the creation of a written national constitution. The govermmnet should respect the 2nd amendment and the law in general. It's pity when some politicians think otherwise. People should understand that a gun is not a killing tool, it's self-defense tool. And we will stand for our right to keep and bear arms!
Remember when African Americans couldn't drink from the same drinking fountains as whites? Remember when gay people couldn't get married? Both scenarios sound so ridiculous. Especially when you think about how much money is to be gained if same-sex couples are legally allowed to get married. A majority of small business owners believe companies shouldn't be allowed to withhold goods or services from lesbian, gay,bisexual or transgender people based on an owner's religious beliefs, according to a survey released Monday. Of course marriage is good for the business - no matter who it is that is marrying. It's a billion dollar industry in our country! I am certain that if a state supported marriage for all, then business would flourish. No one would be offended by not being considered legitimate, when their feelings are legitimate.

VIDEO: TEXAS SCHOOL TEACHER FIRED AFTER MANHANDLING LITTLE BLACK BOY The shocking video shows a Central Texas child trying to get up from a bean bag chair in his classroom, while a Snook Independent School District employee, Troy Vann pushing him repeatedly into it and mocking him again and again. After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher manhandling a small child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was shared thousands of times. In the video footage, Vann also tells the boy: "Tell me no. When I tell you to do something, you do it, boy." After the Burleson County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation, a "behavior specialist" who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young student was fired. The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who abuse any child. The teachers who use excessive force against any child should be removed immediately from the classroom and placed on administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.
I love this. Black Community needs more images of this type of black love and endurance.

CHARLESTON COP WHO FATALLY SHOT BLACK MAN ASKS JUDGE TO DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year- old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to drop murder charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the shooting. According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self- defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: "The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split- second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay.

COPS SHOT AND KILLED CALIFORNIA BLACK WOMAN WHO STRUGGLED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she approached a group of police officers in her car. Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley, who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars. When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting. After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and was pronounced dead. Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, "It's Up to Us," she was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because ignoring it can take away years of people's lives. Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half of people shot by cops are mentally ill? Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals.
On October 15, 1966, Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton have founded BPP. Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party "the greatest threat to the internal security of the country". They tried to close it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was dissolved. 50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that can make Black Lives really matter.

U.S. ARMY LIFTS BAN ON DREADLOCKS. After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in April 2014. The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism. Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress. The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option. Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half- inch wide. Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have different hair texture.

MAN WHO WAS CHARGED WITH BURNING DA VINCI APARTMENT WAS ANGRY ABOUT POLICE KILLINGS OF BLACK PEOPLE The man who was accused of Da Vinci apartment complex arson that caused the city $100 million in damages testified that he was angry at high-profile killing of black men. Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses; he was so mad about the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building. Abdulwalia's anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was trying to send: having a black president changes almost nothing.

Who knew that this little boy might change our lives forever? When Martin Luther King Junior was a child, he built up a dream that one day his family will live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. Years later, he educated and inspired people throughout America and unborn generations.

Come and show on which side you are in the fight against police brutality. Please, join families of people killed by law enforcement at the National Day of Protest Against Police Brutality on October 22. 956 people were killed by police in 2015, and at least 161 of them were unarmed. We all witness justice being gone from this country, and we all understand: each of these stolen lives must never be forgotten. October 22 is a day when thousands of people throughout the country can join forces to express their outrage, sorrow and resistance as a response to the brutality of this system. October 22 is time to show that we all have an opinion, it's time to fight back.

Cops are allergic to cameras, they don't like being recorded because it won't allow them to break the law and lie about the circumstances which presented them the opportunity to break the law. ?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not destruction of evidence a crime? What do you think about it guys? Please, share or comment below.

It's time to talk about important issues. We want to know what do you think about police brutality against black women? I wonder, why is no one talking about black women abused by police? At the time when Americans' attention focuses primarily on the relationship between black men and law enforcement, we've got to admit the fact that Black women have a tough time too. To my mind it should come to national spotlight; from teen girl, who was slammed to the floor in a South Carolina classroom to the mysterious death of Sandra Bland in a jail cell. We want to give you a chance to express yourself and share your minds with us. WATCH the video below, showing black women bringing their problems to the forefront.
Dash cam footage helped a man to escape 5 years in jail! Evidence from a dashboard camera from a police car helped Marcus Jeter, 30 years to escape the jail time after he was falsely accused of resisting arrest and the assault. With the help of this video, all charges were dismissed and the man's name was cleared. Do you need more proofs that cops are lying bastards who would frame anyone to save themselves!
Recently released video of the arrest of 32-year-old Clinton N. Walker proved that cops lied when they said that he was resisting the arrest and assaulted an officer that's why they had to tase and kick him. Cops lied again! These bastards will tell anything to justify their action! Full story: http://bit.ly/1 UCDWgK

When Ebony Hilton was 8, she promised her mother that one day she will become a doctor. Since that moment Ebony's mother called her "Dr. Hilton". It wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were some hardships — for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan B. Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving OurSelves Successfully (GLOSS). That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's inspiring!

New trends. Often "new trends" of American and European cultures is nothing but reinvention of African legacy. People should pay more attention to education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird. White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise. Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We have beautiful culture and history! #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity

Sometimes we can succeed in their game but it's better to concentrate on our own issues. When white people do something for us they see us as strangers anyway, we will always be "others" for them.

Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities. Find out how to escape bad credit reports: goo.gl/GArVbz

Shocking video was captured by the police officer body cam. On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light. The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll down her window "all the way" to receive her ticket. When King refused, which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply citing her, the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground. When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to change. Video source @[540176322666035:274:Police The Police]
Well, there was a reason. The kid was Black! Spread it! People have to know what's heppning, because media won't write about it.
In a recent interview, Barack Obama said that not bombing Syria "required the most political courage". He said that sending troops to Syria was a very difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama was hated for not taking actions, but it's better for being hated for not killing innocent people that for starting a useless war. Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed. Unfortunately, the recent government didn't think twice, before they started bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill innocent kids in Syria. How did we come to this?!

Recently Black women were called the most educated group of people in the US and years by, we can see that those women are starting to make changes. Here and there we hear the news about Black people holding the positions for the first time in history and trust me, it's just a beginning! We are so happy to see the whole nation waking up and realizing the importance of both hustle and education.

Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two months before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two sons. Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in Indianapolis at the age of 26. Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off- duty firefighter. The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said. Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of their cars. At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley. She said the man got inside his car but exited again and "he just started shooting," hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal legally owned the gun and did not fire it. Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began shooting him. "I was hoping my brother wasn't dead," said Boxley. Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year- old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother. "This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They have no consideration for life," - Tiffaney Boxley. Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own death, armed or unarmed. #joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice

End the whining and crying, end the riots with these same white people(democrats), who will not march with you when your son, daughter or loved one gets shot for being Black. I opted out of the elections and i had many Black people all up in my case, telling me how i was wrong and how i needed to make my vote count for Mrs. Clinton, all just to make sure Trump doesn't become president. Well now all i want to say is get over Trump and Clinton, they are rich white people, the elite who were born into and are a part of the system. I dream of liberation, not staying a slave under Hillary or Trump, so forget your childish rioting, no one has shot! #wakeup #organize ##joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice #november8 #elections2016 #black #melanin #blackisbeautiful #blacklivesmatter #blackgirlmagic #USA #blackandproud #democrat #republican #Africanamerican #unite4justice #vote #breakingnews

"Everyone should #buyblack this holiday season in an effort to support the businesses that are the backbone of our neighborhoods and communities. Often times, we overlook our own businesses to purchase products and services from businesses outside of our communities. Many of us have heard the disturbing statistic about a dollar circulating within the black community for only 6 hours compared to approximately 2-4 weeks in white, Jewish, and Asian communities. If we don't support our entrepreneurs, how can we expect others to support our amazing businesses? We must continue to educate and change the mindset of consumers so "buying black" becomes the norm amongst our people and not only an encouragement during the holiday season," said Lonzell Fogle and Breyon Williams, founders of My Suited Life.

"This is my lived experience," Muhammad said. "I'm formerly incarcerated, I spent a lot of my childhood in different systems and I had no idea about the beast that communities of color are fighting. My mother didn't know about the school-to-prison pipeline, she just knew she had a black boy." Coleman explained how his work with wrongfully-convicted clients had shaped his view of the U.S. criminal justice system, which he described as racially lopsided. "It's not by choice that most of my clients are African American," Coleman said. "It's a fact of life and of the prison system. If most of the people going into the system are black men, most of my clients will be too." The Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy hosted a symposium Tuesday focusing on efforts to improve criminal justice and the American prison system. Titled "Intersectionality and the Black Lives Matter Movement," the event featured a panel of speakers, including James Coleman, John S. Bradway professor of the practice of law, and Umar Muhammad, community organizer for the Southern Coalition for Justice, along with Theresa Newman, clinical professor of law. "I didn't feel prepared for the world. I didn't feel rehabilitated. I had no resources," Muhammad said. -The Chronicle-
How can you bring peace to another nation when you have no peace in your own country? Someone help me understand this white man's tactics. We talk about racism everywhere, but then in actual fact we talking about inter-human relationship, international relations and seeing other humans as equal and not inferiors. This war has brought nothing positive and the poor, the masses, people of color are the ones suffering. Let this sink in!! #wokeblacks #PanAfricanism #BlackNationalism #BlackEmpowerment #AfricanEmpowerment #AfricanAndProud #BlackAndProud #BlackPride #BlackPower #BlackLivesMatter #Amerikkka #UnapologeticallyBlack #UnapologeticallyAfrican #BlacklnAmerica #BlacklsBeautiful #KnowThySelf #KnowledgeOfSelf #KnowledgeOfSelflsANationality #EconomicEmpowerment #lntegrationFailed #WhiteliesMatter #Education #AfricanUnification #AfricanUnity #BlackLove #theblackmancan #brotherhood #kings
Korryn Gaines is being betrayed by the system that was designed to oppress and humiliate black people.
We always condemn racism and terrorism because they only affect the poor and less privilege in society. So don't be fooled into making this mistake: The war in Syria is just another rich white man's way to profit at the cost of innocent lives... and yes, Flint is stillwithout clean water. #wokeblacks #PanAfricanism #BlackNationalism #BlackEmpowerment #African Empowerment #AfricanAndProud #BlackAndProud #BlackPride #BlackPower #BlackLivesMatter #Amerikkka #UnapologeticaIIyBlack #UnapologeticallyAfrican #BlacklnAmerica #BlacklsBeautiful #KnowThySelf #KnowledgeOfSelf #KnowledgeOfSelflsANationaIity #EconomicEmpowerment #Integration Failed #WhiteLiesMatter #Education #African Unification #AfricanUnity #BlackLove #theblackmancan #brotherhood #kings

Our heart goes out to the Montgomery family. Andre Montgomery, grandson of Robbie Montgomery, owner of Sweetie Pie's restaurants was shot and killed on Monday night. Much condolence to the Montgomery family.
Last Saturday night. 68-year-old David Rice, also known as Mondo we Langa, a former Black Panther passed away Nebraska prison. In 1970, Rice was one of the two officers who were charged for the murder of Omaha police officer, Larry Minard. Authorities claim they coaxed Larry to a house with a 911 call, and then detonated a homemade bomb that killed him. He was the seventh-longest-serving inmate in Nebraska. Subsequent paroles and retrials were denied for these two men. Langa was in prison for 45 years. Details of the cause of his death are still unknown. Rest in peace, Mondo we Langa. #MondoweLanga #blackpanther #LarryMinard

Actor and comedian Ricky Harris died of a heart attack on Monday, his manager, Cindy Ambers, confirmed in an emailed statement. A cause of death has yet to be released. Harris was well-known for his role as Malva in the Chris Rock series "Everybody Hates Chris,'' as well as for his two-year stint on "Moesha. " He most recently appeared on FX's "The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story." On the big screen, Harris scored a part in 1993's "Poetic Justice" with Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur, starred alongside Robert De Niro in 1995's "Heat," and recently appeared in 2015's "Dope." Harris also collaborated with his childhood friend Snoop Dogg and rappers Ice Cube and Dr. Dre on some of their albums. May his beautiful soul R.l.P!

As we celebrate and reflect upon the birth of the great Martin Luther King Jr., a voice of the people and one who sacrificed his life for the total liberation of Black Americans, the question is "who will keep his dream alive"? He saw the promise-land where blacks and whites live together in harmony and each of them given equal rights and privileges, freedom and justice. Today, we do not see this equality among blacks and whites in America. These rights and privileges, freedom and justice shouldn't be for some selected few but all!
