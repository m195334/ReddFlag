He's lucky to return home to reunite with his family for the holidays. But he's just one of a few servicemen to do this. For many of our brave troops stationed abroad and far from their loved ones. Our brave servicemen and servicewomen will continue to make sacrifices for our great country while the VA employees will be having their dinner and laughing at the VA backlog. Click to Learn More!

Remember that terrible case when a student was forced by York Comprehensive High School officials to remove the Old Glory from his pickup? It happened in May 2015 and luckily had a happy end, as a result the students were allowed to attach our flag to their vehicles. The story ended well by efforts of dozens of patriots united to protest against High School authorities. It was a peaceful but strong and confident protest that made the authorities listen, it was a great example of how conscious people should act. We have to keep ready to stand against all kinds of attacks on American values and Constitutional laws. Unfortunately our current Government approves and even provokes these attacks, and the liberals' offensive and violent moods make it clear — every American patriot has to be careful and attentive.

NOT EVERY BOY WANTS TO BE A SOLDIER. A beautiful message was seen on the streets of the capitol,. with no group name or credits attached to the project. It was the poster at top, of the bearded man in a pink gown behaving like a queen and holding a sign saying "Not every boy wants to be a soldier". A timely message for today. The two recent U.S. wars were costly for our nation; to put it lightly. They led to domestic devastation of country. No matter what Defense Secretary or POTUS are saying they don't fool me with promises of gay military equality as key to the nation's agenda. Better talk to me about cutting DoD's budget. FOLKS. #Igbt #USarmy #CrossDress #GaySoldier #Obama #DefenseBudget #StopWar
Fortunately, some patriots in the United States don't stay away, while traitors destroy this country. Our friends from San Diego organized a rally to support ideas of Donald Trump. Patriots carried and waved American flags, while the Clinton/Sanders supporters carried MEXICAN flags and attempted to confront a very diverse group of Donald Trump supporters. That explains why the Democrats encourage the illegal immigration. They are ready to destroy America just to be elected. We have to defend this nation! Let's organize rallies against the illegal immigration around the whole country! Let's flood the United States with American flags! If you have a desire to organize a rally in your city, please contact us. We can help you. Only our patriotism can save the United States of America!
We have many problems in our country at the moment. Healthcare, education and Veterans are just on the top of the list. But one problem is destroying our country more than anything else. Illegal aliens affect our economy drastically. Not only they sink the job market and steal hundreds of millions of welfare dollars, they also flood America with drugs, which is the worst. Mexican cartels have a stable stream of drugs through the border and our government does nothing with it. To cure our nation we need to get rid of all the gangs and illegal immigrants and build a huge wall so they would never come back!

Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black church in Charlestone *CLICK TO GET LIVE UPDATES ON OUR PAGE* A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore? #CharlestonShooting #chsnews

Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding an assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William Evans. A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33, of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October 12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire themselves. This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the President of the United States. Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country. Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse racism, against those who want to destroy America! Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend the police from terrorists.

UFC Champion Ronda Rousey Calls 9/11 An 'Inside Job' "It's an inside job," said Rousey, who knocked out Bethe Correia in the first 34 seconds of the first round, is joined the club who questions September 11. Rousey's belief is also held by 9/11 victims' family members and countless first responders who witnessed the attacks that fateful morning. While the government continues to denial implication to the 9/11 we still how politicians "care" about our lives. What did they do with ISIS, who beheaded American journalist? What did they do after murder of US citizens in Libya? Such ignorance from the government side make us feel not safe in our own country. Moreover, it looks like the government doesn't really care about lives of Americans. For the last decades America's "leadership" seem to be lackeys of corporations' interests. We should provide a glimpse of reality to prevent such things in the future. So, if we let it go today, they'll do it again and again...

Why am I against individuals who live in the United States illegally? On the one hand, I have nothing against foreigners. On the other hand, I love the United States very much. If the government gives an amnesty to them who broke the immigration law, it doesn't respect Americans who love their country. Why citizens cannot break the law, but illegals can? What nonsense! Illegal immigrants work illegally and they don't pay taxes. Many of them commit a crime. And the police have no their finger prints because illegals have never obtained U.S. visa. If people want to live in the United States, they should require U.S. residence permit. Illegals should not be amnestied. How can we be the greatest nation in the world, if we don't respect our law? I am against illegals not because am chauvinist, but because I am patriot!

The U.S. Constitutional Convention signed and adopted the Constitution at Philadelphia's Independence Hall 228 years ago. Since then the U.S. Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times. All of amendments are steps that made the United States the greatest country in the world. The U.S. Constitution is not only the law, it is the basis of the country. Every true patriot respects it. Unfortunately, last decade has become the time of nihilism. More and more people don't respect American law. More and more people come to the United States and some of them don't feel reverence for our Constitution. It goes without saying that illegals who already broke the immigration law and will violate the supreme law easily. But the worst thing is that the current president of the United States and some high-ranking officials also spit upon the Constitution. They call for ban the right to bear arms, a confederate flag (I think this flag reflects not slavery, but important part of American history) and some liberals ban even the Old Glory -- a school district in Tennessee has banned all flags and banners, including the U.S. flag -- and so on. The same regards the Iran deal. America has a hard time. And we have to save the U.S. Constitution. We have to do it in God's name! America has to be great again because we are one nation under God!
Good morning, dear patriots! Today is 16th of July. The Apollo 11, the first U.S. lunar landing mission, is launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on this day in 1969. It was a great day in history!

Since the game of American football was first played at the collegiate level in the late 1860s, the sport has captivated fans by using both strength and strategy to get the win. With the introduction of the American Professional Football Association, later renamed to the National Football League, audiences saw athletes play more ferociously than ever before. American football has actually became national kind of sports in the United States. We are proud of such players as Michael Vick, Peyton Manning and John Elway. We are proud we live in America!
Our flag is one with colors every so bright A symbol of goodwill and all that's right It is a beacon for those who are oppressed Who pine to live in the land of the blessed The photo of the Apollo 15 space shuttle on the Moon is historic moment in the history of the world. This was the first time that a man stepped foot on the Moon.

HOMOPHOBIA STILL RUNNING STRONG IN AMERICA. Controversial artist Ed Freeman sparked fury among conservative patriots after sharing his own version of the 1945 image. The outrage was caused by artist's artwork recreating iconic Iwo Jima photo. with a gay pride flag and half-naked men has received death threats. That's a bit too harsh treatment for an artist, don't you think? What's this; the American version of Je suis Charlie? Joe Rosenthal's picture of soldiers hauling a flag pole up after declaring the island of Iwo Jima secure during the Second World War won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945. Around 70.000 U.S. troops fought more than 20,000 Japanese. It wasn't a fair fight back then, and it's not a fair fight today. But there's nothing disrespectful in this image. Isn't the imitation is the best form of homage? #homophobia #JoeRosenthal #EdFreeman #IwoJlma

The choosing of the President must be left to the popular vote. Trump won the Electoral College but is behind by nearly 840,000 votes nationally! This is just wrong! The Electoral College is an outdated, undemocratic system that does not reflect our modern society, and it needs to be changed immediately. Every American should be guaranteed that their vote counts. California Sen. Boxer has recently filed a long-shot bill to abolish the Electoral College which undoubtedly does NOT represent the true voice of US. New York Against KKK
The administration is requesting a $54 billion increase in military spending for 2018. Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of 2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high- powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria. Start thinking!
