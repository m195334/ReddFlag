The leader of radical religious group Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, announced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on October 10, 2015 in Washington, D.C., at the National Mall. Organizers of the Million Man March call for justice, standing against the police and for blacks, Latinos and incarcerated. They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among radical groups. Only black activists say "black lives matter", forgetting the fact that justice is when all lives matter. Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should be imprisoned. Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions. This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on American extremists to execute him. There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he should live here legally; he should not break the law. It's justice.
We insist over and over again: Black Lives Matter is a radical hate group and its violent actions must be stopped. And we're glad to know that our police officials are on our side on that issue.

Click to Learn More! In the 1730s, a seven-year-old English girl was washed up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of today's Xhosa royal families. Due to her recessive gene, now and then a child is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced.

Prominent Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King revealed to be white Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King has claimed for years that he is biracial, being born to a white mother and a black father. But recently uncovered records claim he misled the public about his race, and that he is in fact a white man pretending to be black. King's race would not be under scrutiny if it was not an essential component of his career, education and social status. In addition to getting a full-ride scholarship that is exclusively for black men, King has the position of "Justice Columnist" at progressive news website Daily Kos and enjoys a 169,000-strong follower count on Twitter, most of whom are a result of his activism following the death of Mike Brown in Ferguson.

King still did not directly answer the simple yes or no question about his ethnic background: Are you black? Instead, he said, "If you have known me from when I was in elementary school at Huntertown Elementary until now, you've known me as black or bi-racial." Turning blackness into a performance is anti-blackness—irrespective of whether the white person doing it is Rachel Dolezal or Shaun King.

We must ensure the Dallas attack on police will never happen again. Most problems we face happen because we've stopped calling things by their names and the assassination of cops in Dallas was no exception. We're hiding behind political correctness and denying the truth because we don't want to `offend' someone. And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent's rallies and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives Matter are terrorists, and the sooner we admit it officially — the sooner this war on cops will end and people running a conservative rally won't be afraid to be attacked by a hateful gang.

Our hearts are heavy with grief that we have lost another vibrant member of our community too soon. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of Amber's family and friends whom she clearly loved deeply. Trans woman murdered in Detroit. According to initial police reports, 20-year- old Amber Monroe was shot to death. A lot of transgendered women don't have support systems or employment. So they are forced to do whatever they can do to survive. This attack was fueled by transphobia and we do know that Amber's murder is the 12th murder of a transgender woman in the United States this year, and the 10th murder of a transgender woman of color. Transgender women, and especially transgender women of color, are disproportionately affected by violence. Her life was just beginning... I know that this loss will leave so many people with a hole in their lives and with more questions than answers. Let's work for real change so that our transgender sisters can be free from persecution. I know we can do better. We have to do better!
The police report that the Black Lives Matter terrorist sniper Micah Johnson used to buildings owned by Muslim Arabs to carry his attack. If you think it was just a coincidence, you make a mistake. Johnson got set up in one building and moved more than 10 miles away to another building owned by the same people to shoot from. It doesn't look like it is a coincidence. Moreover, some witnesses said that they saw Jonson visiting a mosque. Muslims seem to be not peace-loving as they say. And I don't want to see 10.000 potential terrorists here in Texas.

COLIN KAEPERNICK DONATED TO BLACK YOUTH PROJECT 100 Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating to the Black Youth Project 100. Kaepernick donated to the Chicago chapter of the organization toward "Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to Build Black Futures" which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States of America. "I'll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those communities," he said. When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don't really care about haters. Good job, Colin.

January 15 marks the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., a great man who spent his public career working toward ending segregation and fighting racial discrimination.

There is no appropriate age to fight for your rights and stand for your community. No matter how young you are, you should realize what happens and take the stance of action. If you see that everyone else's effort wasn't enough, you should contribute, too. Just look at this girl. She understands that the problem exists and she's trying to tell people around the country about it. We think she is hoping for the best. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #flint

Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee(SNCC) in summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company. One of co-founders said "We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support." Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history, something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of the shop: the drum is for "communications within the diaspora," and the spear symbolizes "whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the people." The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice. This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores. Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a "free spaces"for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear today, in 2017. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #drumandspear #blackpower
Leon Moss, 12, is Atlanta resident. His mother discovered Leon's talent when he was 9-year-old. She began to take him to local museums such as the Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank Museum of Natural History. To improve Leon's skills of painting he began to attend art classes of R. Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth Business Organization(SWAYBO)also helped Leon in many ways. According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of "poise and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black community." Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book with his illustrations is As Big As God. That's what we call the support of family and the community! Good luck, Leon! We should believe in ourselves just like Leon's mother believed in him. Our roots are strong; just imagine how strong you can be if only you grow with your roots! #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #leonmoss #art #blackart

This one is for ya'all brothers! If you exclusively date outside of your ethnicity and culture, you hate yourself. Don't talk to me until you start to love yourself. I'm going to get many people complaining about this post... I don't care. If you won't check for your own people, seek help not more approval. I'm not saying you should ever check for people outside of your culture, I am saying brothers if every women you have ever been with, isn't from your culture/ethnic group, you have issues of the mind. You are doing this not by love but on purpose, because you hate yourself subconsciously, it's ok, just love yourself and heal your illness. ? #westandtogether #melanin #blackisbeautiful #blacklivesmatter #blackgirlmagic #USA #blackandproud #Africanamerican #unite4justice #melanin #icantbreathe #hood #blackgirl #blackbeauty #darkskin #blackqueen #blackqueens #problack #afro #afrocentric #boycott #november8 #elections2016 #ripaltonsterling #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher

Ladies & Gents, today we remember one of the realest ever Lone Rangers,. Bass Reeves. Mostly described as the "lawman second to none," a man who was "absolutely fearless and also labelled, the Black Hero Marshal. Reeves was born to slave parents in 1838 in Crawford County Arkansas, but Bass Reeves would become the first black U.S. Deputy Marshal west of the Mississippi River and one of the greatest frontier heroes in the history of this country. #PanAfricanism #BlackNationalism #BlackEmpowerment #African Empowerment #AfricanAndProud #BlackAndProud #BlackPride #BlackPower #BlackLivesMatter #Amerikkka #UnapologeticallyBlack #UnapologeticallyAfrican #BlacklnAmerica #BlacklsBeautiful #KnowThySelf #KnowledgeOfSelf #KnowledgeOfSelfIsANationaIity #EconomicEmpowerment #Integration Failed #WhiteLiesMatter #Education #African Unification #AfricanUnity #BlackLove #JusticeOrElse #ProBlack #Regrann #blackexcellence #goals #woke

I see many young Black girls skating and excelling in a field that used to be predominantly white. In the sense that efforts were really made to prevent Black people from participating in such sports, back in the days. But thanks to Debi Thomas and other Black skaters; we changed the game and on Feb. 8. 1986. Debi became the first Black skater to hold a US national titles in ladies' single figure scating. Debi; a physician, became the 1986 World champion, the 1988 Olympic bronze medalist; and a two-time U.S. national champion. #PanAfricanism #BlackNationalism #BlackEmpowerment #African Empowerment #AfricanAndProud #BlackAndProud #BlackPride #BlackPower #BlackLivesMatter #Amerikkka #UnapologeticallyBlack #UnapologeticallyAfrican #BlacklnAmerica #BlacklsBeautiful #KnowThySelf #KnowledgeOfSelf #KnowledgeOfSelflsANationaIity #EconomicEmpowerment MntegrationFailed #WhiteLiesMatter #Education #African Unification #AfricanUnity #BlackLove #JusticeOrElse #ProBlack #Regrann #blackexcellence #goals

Whoever doubted her should start to believe that determination based on the truth of one's "self' is the key to success. Yes she still looks hot and cute and sexy and much more beautiful than a million women of all races who put on so many make-up, tarnishing the original melanin strength.

There's a lot of mythology surrounding redheaded people, but one ignorant assumption trumps them all: Redheads are white. The reality? They're not. Photographer @IamMichelleMarshall is raising awareness of this fact through her photo series "M1 CR" the series, named after the gene variant responsible for red hair and freckles, features individuals of Afro-Caribbean descent who carry this gene and, therefore, embody certain aesthetic traits associated with redheads." #melaninqueen #dope #beautiful #wakeup #wewillsurvive #organize ##joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice #november8 #elections2016 #black #melanin #blackisbeautiful #blacklivesmatter #blackgirlmagic #USA #blackandproud #democrat #republican #Africanamerican #unite4justice #vote #breakingnews

Meet Joseph Wicks, the man whose biggest dream is to save old house in downtown Charleston. Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe Street that's being displaced by development says he's doing it to make a statement. "It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something that's not done here by black folk. said Joseph Wicks; who now owns the house at 33 Woolfe St. `None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted toward black folk." Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most. The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it cant be torn down! I'm so proud of this man! He is making a real movement! Actions like this can protect our history!
Prior to cooking delicious five-star cuisine, celebrity chef Jeff Henderson cooked something else entirely dangerous—cocaine. As a teenager, Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles. By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for cooking, while he was on kitchen duty. He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can achieve in life with the right choices.
