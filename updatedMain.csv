For many parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your continued relationship with your son or daughter. Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during that time. Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you choose that lifestyle. I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the impact of what we're being told (""That's nice. dear. and what do you want for dinner?""). Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality. you would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept secret from you. and you would never really know the whole person. It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment for some time with their sexuality. someone who has reached the point of telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"". On the contrary. he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering. ""Is she/he sure?"" the answer will almost always be ""yes""!

But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first openly trans soldier of the US Army. He's astonishingly handsome. he works out constantly (check out his muscular build). he covered in tattoos. he's part black. Latino and Cherokee. he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska. Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve. SGT Ortega has been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army paperwork. he is identified as a woman. But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

Margie Winters was fired as director of religious education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she just married her wife. but because some parents just found out that she's been married for all eight years. Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is the biggest mistake! When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about homosexuality. they conclude that there must be something wrong about being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and harassment. Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs.

Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband. who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested. taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail. Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate. Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed.

So this time we would like to make a #flashmob against #HillaryClinton because she is the real enemy of black community and our followers prove it showing their disgrace to her personality and policy. That's why we ask you to do the same and send your photos to us. Why? Because we want to live in a better future and Hillary is not the person who will help us in getting justice and peace by all means!

In the 1730s. a seven-year-old English girl was washed up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of today's Xhosa royal families. Due to her recessive gene. now and then a child is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced.

The second coalition strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more civilians.

EPA. State and other development programs. Agriculture. Labor. Justice. Health and Human Services. Education. and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in their budgets. and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%. However. terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they won't be destroyed in the closest perspective. I mentioned before. and I will do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war 'for freedom'. it's another example of money conflict. filling politician's pockets with blood money is the main goal of it.

As we all know. CPS has been struggling financially. and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists. but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful. still be self-made... Once again. thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love. Chicago. Sincerely. Alex Rojas. Alondra Cerros. and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago. Illinois"" It's not the full letter. but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who cares for them. We are sure. that Chano needs it. Love should be given back. It should work. As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget who made him famous. Artists are made of talent. work and people's love. That's cool that this love goes back and forth! We need more of these positive black people on the media. because some people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day different race will be the issue of diversity. not stereotypes. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #chancetherapper #chicago #music #hiphop #rap"," Black Excellence                                                    idl Like Page Sponsored • N ""First and foremost. we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank you for the supportive donation to our schools.

And here are some real Clinton decisions: —Last year. Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. —In 2007. Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006. Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003. Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits."" In other words. Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society. but still practically no one raises these concerns.

Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) sponsored the bill. which aimed to ""modernize"" two references to ""Orientals"" and ""Negros"" in the U.S. Code that date to the 1970's. The words will be replaced with ""Asian Americans"" and ""African Americans."" respectively. ""The term `Oriental' has no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be gone for good."" Meng said in a statement on Friday. Obama signed the bill shortly before leaving for his trip to Vietnam and Japan. where he will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima.

The goal was to ""disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations."" Well. the intervention deprived al-Qaida of a sanctuary. But al-Qaida — even after its leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos — has spawned cells elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So. the question is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the mission that hardly can be called successful?

Tuscaloosa police said Saturday. Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum. more commonly known as pepper spray. according to police. The chemical agent debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's nose and throat. The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during an investigation. according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and body camera footage of the incident would be released after that investigation. This tragedy happen accidentally. and probably the police officers didn't wish death upon him. because they tried to give him first aid. However. the man is dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever. but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this acceptable? We will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over. Let's wait and keep our eyes open.

Mississippi allegedly strangled Sanders. a 39-year-old black horseman. with a flashlight before killing him in view of his family members. Officer Kevin Herrington pulled Sanders off a horse and choked him with a flashlight. Sander's attorney. Stewart Parrish. initially told an ABC affiliate. Parrish later clarified that those allegations came from family members who witnessed the death. Parrish said that Sanders experienced ""some kind of asphyxiation"" during the altercation. Sanders died on the scene and leaves behind two children. The last words of Eric garner were ""I can't breathe."" the last words of Jonathan Sanders were ""I can't breathe. let me go"".

Today. his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that he experienced in school and on the streets. People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the North American continent. For instance. in West Baltimore. Ta-Nehisi was trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat to you. Moreover. his mom was feared that her children would get arrested. What does it mean? Undoubtedly. black Americans were afraid of police. improper procedure. injustice or what is worse. being killed by police officer. That's why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in America. In fact. this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed people of color killed by police.

""Black features are beautiful. black women are not."" Stenberg wrote. ""White women are paragons of virtue and desire. black women are objects of fetishism and brutality. This. at least. seems to be the mentality surrounding black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty standards."" Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However. all the news about killing black men and black teenagers. police brutality. unfair sentences and other issues. distract us from the fact that black women are being abused in the most violent ways.

Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann. who shot Rice. and his partner. Frank Garmback. to face charges in the shooting. Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a city recreation center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun. Rice. who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots pellets. died the next day. By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops. who should've been never employed even.

Hodges refused to leave his house after he was not able to pay his mortgage while caring for his sick wife. Police and ambulance workers had to carry him away on a stretcher. A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for decades. But about four years ago; he was taking care of his wife. who had Alzheimer's disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the process. he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling $73;000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately. due to his default on his mortgage loan payments. he was evicted from his house on a stretcher. Why does the U.S. government treat military veterans absolutely disgracefully? Why the WWII veterans are literally being treated like human garbage by their own government? How potentially disabled veteran was evicted from his house?

Last Saturday the 16-year-old Brandon Claxton prompted an officer to shoot him three times in a housing complex in Hodiamont Avenue. According to police. they responded to a call about someone with a stolen 40-caliber pistol. Brandon Claxton is in critical conditions. But according to witnesses. Brandon did not point a pistol at anyone but he was trying to run away from the officers. Where is the video evidence of police shooting? Police Chief Sam Dotson said that there is not a clear view on video. What if police is trying to cover up the story? Did you know that police did not allow Brandon's mother to see her son because he was in custody? Do you believe that police was justified to arrest Brandon? Cameras don't lie!

'cause they couldn't afford to pay bail. Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last week. some 3.000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department. the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or disorderly conduct. The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what should we do? The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse. it is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep people in prison. rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a business. The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government will start to sell indulgences soon. Our system is not only unfair. but also corrupt! We should explore alternative solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail! Lemme ask you. have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other Presidents administrations were brought to justice.

Due to her bad health history she was taken to the hospital and released. But she died in jail waiting for someone to help. According to American legislation. the courthouse officials are supposed to check the cell every fifteen minutes but. no one checked Tumer's cell for more than two hours.

Sandra Bland from Texas. Kindra Chapman from Alabama. Joyce Curnell from South Carolina. Ralkina Jones from Ohio. and Raynetta Turner from New York were found dead in their cell after being arrested by police officers.

Being one of the 17 children of former slaves she was the first and the only child to go to African-American school. She found the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls because she believed that education was the key to racial advancement. In addition; Bethune did a lot of work to contribute to American society. For instance; she was the president of the Florida chapter of the National Association of Colored Women. Moreover. in 1935 Mary Bethune became an advisory to President Roosevelt on minority affairs and later on she started her civil rights organization. the National Council of Negro Women.

Miller fired four shots. including the fatal bullets from the gun of Miller. A second officer fired a taser. Johnson said.

Never was involved in criminal activities. 2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and was working under the supervision of a training officer. 3) Taylor didn't want to die young.

But when the suspect ran of the car. three officers opened fire. The suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital. Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers?

Because if a stranger follows your child after him/her buy a bag of Skittles. ran back into the store. Remember. anything is better than dying.

These Cops Severely Beat a Blind Autistic Teen Unconscious During the incident. Abrams. 17. suffered two seizures after police used force against him at the Green Line's Lexington Parkway Station. The teen suffers from Asperger's syndrome. which causes him to strongly dislike being touched or having people in his person space. and is considered legally blind. wearing extremely magnified glasses. Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify forcibly taking him down. which resulted in him being battered and left unconscious. Abrams non-compliance wasn't done out of malice. but out of not really understanding the situation. and believing he hadn't done anything wrong. Abrams' autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions or feelings of others. according to his mother. Police released the teen to the custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.

DC answering the call from Minister Louis Farrakhan to come to the nation's capital and show our strength in numbers and unity and remind politicians that our voices would be heard. 20 years later. we return to call on our politicians to fix our broken criminal justice system once and for all. I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world. To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken Windows."" This is why I march.

Oregon. The shooting took place in classrooms in Snyder Hall. Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a fight. because he had body armor and stash of ammunition. One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's religions before he began firing. The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34. and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had volunteered to help. It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some gun control yet? Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's white. And honestly. word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it terror? Oh. wait.

One of the five injured. a 19-year-old black teenager Clanton passed away on the way to hospital. In fact. the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident.

S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president. Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately. American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism. tolerance for Islamophobia. racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance. last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore? #CharlestonShooting #chsnews,P(1)0002127,#charlestonshooting#chsnews,https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/,,,NewsFeed_desktopcomputers; NewsFeed_mobiledevices,18 _ 65+,United States,Maryland; Missouri; Ohio,Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson.

When 24-year-old DaJuawn Wallace saw flashing blue police lights in his rearview mirror he chose to proceed with caution since some people are known to be robbed by fake police officers. He preferred to find a well-lit area to pull over in. As a result. he was charged with 'fleeing' police. People are terrified by the police to such a degree that they even prefer to communicate with officers only in the well-lit areas. And get charged for that.

Cornel West called him the first ""niggerized"" president in an appearance on CNN. West criticized Obama as ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy."" ""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and fighting against white supremacy."" West explained. ""So when many of us said we have to fight against racism. what were we told?'No. he can't deal with racism because he has other issues. political calculations. He's the president of all America. not just black America.' We know he's president of all America but white supremacy is American as cherry pie."" West is right as usual. African minorities would choose Mr. West in 2009 and 2012 instead of Obama. But we had no choice. Cornel is a good leader. he knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks from police pressure. never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The number is horrific.",P(1)0002243,,https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1 579673598947501/,,,NewsFeed_desktopcomputers; NewsFeed_mobiledevices,18 _ 65+,United States,Maryland; Missouri; Ohio,Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson.

The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up during the van ride. and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown against the van wall when the vehicle changed direction. Like really? When police took Gray to the hospital. doctors determined that he had sustained a severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so. It's hard to believe. Do they think we're idiots or something? Cops imprison you. shoot you. sever your spine. crush your larynx. send you to war. keep you poor. call you a thug and get away with it.

Amari Brown. a 7-year-old boy on the city's West Side. was the youngest of the fatalities. Those 30 shootings came between 9:20 p.m Saturday and 4:45 a.m. Sunday. Amari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and down the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other relatives in Humboldt Park. Just before midnight. a gunman opened fire outside a relative's home where Amari and other children were playing. hitting both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the chest. No arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference Sunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in. How can we feel safe here in America? Permanent threat to life follows every American like a shadow. What did this boy do to deserve a bullet in his body? He just played with his friends outdoor.

But what if American criminal justice reform outdated and the country need to focus on a renewed sense of justice? What if disproportionate punishment is the main challenge of the criminal justice system? Disproportionate punishments known far and wide across the United States of America. Consequently. the victim's skin color plays a crucial role in deciding what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance. you are more likely to be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking. if the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots. then they must think about the living standards of black population that is several times below the living standards of white people in America. In addition. the White House must reduce the unemployment rates of black population by revising the hiring policy for black Americans.Therefore. if we want a life's balance. the government have to reconsider all these things. because Black Americans lives matter.,P(1)0002256,,https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/,,,NewsFeed_desktopcomputers; NewsFeed_mobiledevices,18 _ 65+,United States,Maryland; Missouri; Ohio,Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson.

S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president. Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately. American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism. tolerance for Islamophobia. racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance. last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities?

And now they claim enourmous victory. Under the Constitution. treaties require the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long- term agreement between sovereign powers. in which hundreds of billions of dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed. Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators. Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators. not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama. But Obama is not stupid. he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote — not of approval. like a treaty. but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate. and if they turned thumbs-down. he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto — and in that case. the vote has to be by two-thirds. So. instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal. 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember. 41 Senators agree to support the deal. Thus. it may well be that for the first time in American history. a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42 percent. Barack Obama is very smart man. but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care about Americans.

A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect. Kirk Figueroa. 33. of East Boston. critically injured two Boston police officers late on October 12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire themselves. This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be destructive if Hillary Clinton. the main hardliner against cops. will become the President of the United States. Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country. Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse racism. against those who want to destroy America!

A copy of the alert said that the wife of a U.S. military member was approached in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May. Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June. We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the U.S. military has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties. First of all. the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military. Secondly. families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the U.S. Military family members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn't worth a dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a negative scenario there won't be any need in their work. And this will be the final nail in the coffin of the American secret services. Let's remember the last FBI and NSA failures. such as failure to stop the Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the other end of the world and they deserve that their families should be kept safe., P(1)0002277 Being Patriotic                                   dr Like Page qV           Sponsored - 0 The threat of possible ISIS attacks on the U.S. Military families has risen U.S. Senator Cory Gardner. a Republican from Colorado said in a statement that he was alarmed by the reports of an FBI alert that relatives of the US military personnel in Wyoming and Colorado were harassed outside their homes by Middle Eastern men and might have been under surveillance.

The figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration—meaning the total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would actually be larger than 1.24 million. Of course. the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage. today there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low wages. So. besides social problem. immigrants threaten the U.S. economy. Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state budget. Working illegaly. they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions increases crime rates. Moreover. more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of people in the United States speak a foreign language at home. according to a report of the Center for Immigration Studies. You see. increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates social and economic problems. However. we have a risk not only to worsen the U.S. economy. but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of Babel. we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us.

Tennessee and killed four U.S. Marines at the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center. Authorities say a man was a practicing Muslim. At present FBI is conducting an investigation. According to his beliefs. Mohammad was a fundamental Islamist. Having examined after his death his social pages. FBI has found that he kept a blog and had a note where he said that he conducted a terrorist act in obedience to Allah. It is notable that the terrorist attack was conducted in the last day of Ramadan. It is noteworthy that in his letter the terrorist didn't refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own volition. We don't want to stir up Islamophobia. but if such manifestations of Islam have place. it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on their own commit such attacks. the American society must take it more seriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam. according to which. on the one hand Muslims and Christians will live comfortable together. And on the other hand.

But Obama's administration is tied to the chariot of immigrants. Democrats know that immigrants will vote for the Democratic party. Especially former illegals. That's why Barack Obama tries to give the Immigration Amnesty to illegals as soon as possible. It will allow to increase a number of votes for a Democratic Party presidential candidate in 2016. And democrats don't care about the fact that most of immigrants will become welfare recipients. increasing unemployment rate. America doesn't need immigrants. democrats do.

People trying to change the gender on a passport only need to be in transition. not post-surgery. But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical reasons. health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats. It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\her identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next. or vice versa. It is about much more deep. more complex things. An authentic transgender man or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they were assigned to at birth. Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible. Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you were assigned to at birth.

Let's take a look at just how crazy this pledge gets. That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55 percent! But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ""work to overturn any Supreme Court decision"" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans. but at this point. legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge. Also. NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws. creating loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states — so it's a huge concern. And fifth. they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure. gays and lesbians are harassed every day. fired. kicked out of their homes and schools. separated from their families. but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it! There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics. When they finally kick the bucket. they'll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly face it or not) that their Life's Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they worked for made anyone's life better. At all. They didn't win. and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable. And when they're dead and gone. they'll be remembered only as footnotes in shameful history — or more likely they'll be forgotten completely. #LGBT #NOM #SameSexMarriage #Marriage #SCOTUS #equality", P(1)0002571 P(1)0002572 LGBT Unfted                                        .ifi Like Page Sponsored - 4 NOM'S LAST ATTEMPT TO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge.

Reports indicate that he has just put forth a $1.3 billion budget proposal. to be distributed among 75.000 minors that are expected to cross into the United States this year from Central America. That breaks down to about $17.613 a child—an amount that is significantly higher than what the government gives to Social Security Retirees. According to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies. the average annual SSA retirement benefit for legal citizens is roughly $14.772. As if that weren't enough. the proposal also demands another $2.1 billion for refugees. This just says it all. Again and again he ignores the needs of American citizens. but has no problem taking their hard earned money just give it to people who deserve it the least.

He came there and he lectured officers who are targeted every day for assassination by Black Lives Matter that they need to change.

TWO GEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college student during a traffic stop. According to a police report; 21-year-old Demetrius Hollins was pulled over near Lawrenceville for changing lines several times without signaling. When cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the second cop racing to the scene later. only to stomp Hollins in his face. The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have anything where he could hurt him. but police beat him. Moreover. after the incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame. This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal charges. even though they admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice?

According to ex-cop's attorneys. their defendant acted in self- defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times. hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: ""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split- second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam. ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car. Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video. Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this. it's harsh penalty to pay.", P(1)0002859 Slacktivist                                       ih Like Page Sponsored - 0 CHARLESTON COP WHO FATALLY SHOT BLACK MAN ASKS JUDGE TO DROP CHARGES.

After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's hair. the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in April 2014. The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism. Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover. every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus. the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress. The ban on locs. which was part of Army Regulation 670-1. remained until January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option. Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half- inch wide. Well. it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have different hair texture., P(1)0002915 Slacktivist                                    1i   Like Page Sponsored - 0 U.S. ARMY LIFTS BAN ON DREADLOCKS.

Unfortunately. many of these hypocrites have infiltrated the American establishment. Such people benefit from regional conflicts and war is nothing more than business for them. It was these people who launched the missiles that never hit no terrorists but led to civilian casualties. It is them who keep receiving money from the same actors who sponsor ISIS and other groups. These people want more American involvement because it means more money for them and they don't care about the terrorists. In fact. radicals really help them increase their bloody income. The only way to resist the corrupt elites is to oppose military actions with no particular aim and promote anti-terrorist agenda!

The video shows how officers. Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez. brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home; when Morsi- Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license; Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover. Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only victim. her kids had suffered from pepper spray too. The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held personally and financially responsible for their actions. Could you imagine. if soldiers acted like this towards civilians in a combat zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another attitude to people in blue?,P(1)0003439,,https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/,,,NewsFeed_desktopcomputers; NewsFeed_mobiledevices,18 _ 65+,United States,,,,,,People who like Don't Shoot.

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that's why he was hit with a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them. FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the trigger two more times. As usual. no charges were ever filed against the officers involved in Bethea's death. There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20 minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in prison for murder.

Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face is priceless. The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver. who had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125. The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11 years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon. To my mind. this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun. Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give our citizens a chance to get back home alive.

In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school. a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union. of which the alleged victim. Brian Burney. the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student. who recorded the incident. was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer. who is twice the size of Burney. on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover. don't you think it's a bit strange. when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously. police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie.

They believe it is justifiable to shoot someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their eyes. It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the difference? The difference in mindset. American cops truly believe they will get away with it.

We found old dashcam footage has revealed the startling moment a Texas trooper ran toward a motorcyclist following a high-speed chase. leaped into the air and karate kicked him to the ground. The incident unfolded in December 2012 after Martinez. a 10-year veteran trooper. took chase when 25-year-old Steven Gaydos ran a stop sign near Houston. Apparently this Texas deputy wanted to go back to the good old days and show off his fancy moves by jumping in the air and kicking this guy who was already surrendering off his motorcycle. Wow. bad cops with Rambo mentality issues should be dismissed and forbidden from ever owning any firearm again. period!,P(1)0003600,,https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/,,,NewsFeed_desktopcomputers; NewsFeed_mobiledevices,18 _ 65+,United States,Minnesota,Minneapolis Minnesota,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4

Cops are programmed to take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are judge. jury and executioner. and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law. it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their eyes. It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the difference? The difference in mindset. American cops truly believe they will get away with it. In comparison with other countries. particularly in the UK. cops understand that their job is to apprehend. NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you. they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job.

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential campaign. but did you support us before campaign? We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq. we are Muslims and Americans. so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their homes. and also millions of Iraqi Muslims. including innocent men. women and children. to die in their homes. and for what? Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI- Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came. we saw. he died"". Let's not forget about Benghazi. where you declined to increase the embassy security. and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were also injured in the attacks. You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the countries there in chaos. which led to the birth of ISIS. which is now a threat not only to the U.S. but the whole world! You are supporting gun control. disarming the American citizens and at the same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders. creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya. Iraq. Afghanistan and Syria. 8 years ago you were against refugees. but now you support them. 10 years ago you were against same sex marriage. but now you support it. You change your views very fast.

Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over the course of the investigation. authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth. eight pounds of marijuana. 49.3 grams of heroin. four handguns and $2.5 million in cash. according to a press release. ""It would be safe to say that the money would be taken back to Mexico. and that's where the source of the cocaine was."" special agent Tim Stone said. This is good news. but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands. which makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to prevent drug influx. but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The most part of this poison comes through southern border. but it is still as unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as they can. At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth. our government officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.

The man was arrested right in the Capitol and charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief. It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale. Nevertheless. this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda influences even on Southern people. The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people's respect. It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names!

They argue there are many unreliable people in the United States. They think this argument gives them the right to spit upon commandments of our Founding Fathers. But if the problem is mentally ill thugs. maybe we should toughen up firearms licensing rules for people from most dangerous districts? It doesn't mean we propose to ban guns there. But these people should be carefully checked regarding the systematic use of drugs and mental disorders. And I would not be surprised if most of people who failed drug tests were liberals. Maybe it sounds rude a bit. But we found a similar idea among petitions for Obama's administration on the White House website. Do you support this petition?

It is well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist. Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all these SJWs. let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out. while a white soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance. Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the ""racist"" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until 1864 regardless of his skin color.

The founder and editor-in-chief of Black Millennial and one of the organizers of Black Lives Matter NYC Arielle Newton is 23-years-old. She is black college-educated woman who is drawing in $160.000 student loan debt. Today. Arielle is centered on the roots causes racism and resulting epidemic discrimination and socioeconomic illness. In fact. in her opinion the candidates for the next president of the United States of America are problematic in terms of lack of transparency and accountability. For instance. one candidate is complicit in fueling the war on drugs; another one in corrupted criminal justice system. next one in making racial justice as the centerpiece of the campaign as a strategy to have more black voters. Doubtless. voting won't bring us safety and won't provide us an immediate conduit for our social well-being. Ironically. even the first black president of the United States of America was not able to withstand the racist opposition and law enforcement. It means voting again for anti-black system won't save black lives. but might jeopardize it.,P(1)0006448,,https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/,,,NewsFeed_desktopcomputers; NewsFeed_mobiledevices,18 _ 65+,United States,Maryland; Missouri; Ohio,Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson.

So. a family from Moseley. Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway. took out his gun. chambered a round. pointed it at the family. ""He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me. he pulled out a gun. chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now."" Mark Wilson said. When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral. it is beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that slavery was legal in many countries of the world. but nobody wants to ban a flag of England or France. Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished. including the carving at Stone Mountain. the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even demanding that Washington. DC be renamed in the name of political correctness because George Washington owned slaves. Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans should be guided by the law. because sometimes moral is not clear. If somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral. nobody demands to eliminate the party. Continue to stay for the First amendment! Let's stop the chaos!"," P(1)0006457 Being Patriotic                                    Like Page 4-.
