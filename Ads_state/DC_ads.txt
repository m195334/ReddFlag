The leader of radical religious group Nation of Islam. Louis Farrakhan. announced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on October 10. 2015 in Washington. D.C.. at the National Mall. Organizers of the Million Man March call for justice. standing against the police and for blacks. Latinos and incarcerated. They say racism rises among the police officers. but in fact it rises among radical groups. Only black activists say "black lives matter". forgetting the fact that justice is when all lives matter. Americans are not against blacks. Latinos. etc. But if somebody breaks the law. he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit. he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the immigration law. he should be deported. If somebody kills a man. he should be imprisoned. Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam. I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions. This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim communities. This is a bad idea. especially if we take into account the recent news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal Robert O'Neill. the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden. and called on American extremists to execute him. There is no problem. if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he should live here legally; he should not break the law. It's justice.

The Justice Department is set to release about 6.000 inmates from federal prisons in a bid to reduce overcrowding. It is the largest one-time release of federal prisoners. The Department will release drug offenders who received harsh sentences over the last three decades. Every third of them is illegal immigrant. Barack Obama has criticized overblown sentencing laws that "disproportionately impact communities of color." But is it indeed a reason to release criminals? If Latinos commit crimes often than whites. it doesn't mean that some Latino criminals should escape penalty.

All Roads Lead To Washington D.C. On October 10. 2015 in Washington. D.C.. at the National Mall. The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan will convene the 20th Anniversary of the Million Man March under the theme: Justice or Else! "The Million Man March was one of the most historic organizing and mobilizing events in the history of Black people in the United States." said Chicago-based Dr. Conrad Worrill. who was a main organizer of the March and the current president emeritus of the National United Black Front. The widespread death. rising racism. mob attacks and police brutality on Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty. requires that something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition. We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick Douglas said " Power concedes nothing except by a demand". Our demand of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the brotherhood. It's really important for all of us. brothers and sisters. Join the Movement! 10-10-15 Justice Or Else!

Muhammad Ali. the greatest boxer this world has ever known. is no more. The fact that he is gone is difficult to come to terms with; for years. Ali was renowned as a larger than life figure. the greatest. as he called himself. and the demise of a man of such a high stature is surely a void that can never be filled. In the world of sports. Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular culture. he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things unrelated to boxing. and would always take the right stand when needed. He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War. Furthermore. he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process. was accused of committing a felony. Now that he is gone. this world is left with memories. and a void that cannot be filled. May Allah rest his soul in peace and paradise!!!
