Well. as you know. schools are places of learning and also miniature societies. The school climate has a direct impact on both how well students learn and how well they interact with other people. More and more teachers today understand the importance of socialization and try to make their classes more friendly where each student feels involved. But despite these efforts. students who are LGBT continue to face a harsh reality.... May 24.25 Westboro baptist church is planning to stand against tolerance in education system near LGBT-friendly Lawrence High School.

Hate does seem to be a Christian ideal.... 3rd federal court case seeks to block Mississippi LGBT law A diverse group of gay. straight and transgender people have filed the third federal court challenge seeking to block a Mississippi law that lets clerks cite religious beliefs to recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses to same- sex couples. The lawsuit filed Friday says House Bill 1523 violates the separation of church and state by favoring "certain narrow religious beliefs that condemn same-sex couples who get married. condemn unmarried people who have sexual relations and condemn transgender people." How many times do we have to do this? Your BELIEFS don't supersede my RIGHTS!! You just want to use your religious beliefs as an excuse to deliberately harm others and have no consequences for doing so! You can believe whatever you wish. but you cannot use those beliefs to deny me my rights!
