Don't shoot we want to grow up!

Is that justice? Public officials assaulted a man without any consequences. How and why does the government allow it?

Everyday we watch. read and receive news of police beating. assaulting. and killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now. karma's coming back for blue pigs! A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts. who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws. they can break your arms and legs. torture you with chemical and electrical ways. rape or even kill you "doing their job." All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around. the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it. but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior. and this is why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it. we should fight as our ancestors did it for centuries. Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen.

Rookie Florida cop arrested. fired after being caught on video beating up handcuffed strip club employee Video shows probationary patrol officer Akinyemi Borisade repeatedly hitting 31-year-old Mayra Martinez on Wednesday at the Duval County jail. Man. there were so many ways to fix the situation without resorting to use excessive force. The worst part of it is how everyone just stands around nonchalantly.? People who support cops and belive in good cops. please tell me why the hell a bunch of cops just stand and watch how another cop beating a woman??? How??? How can we respect law enforcement. if they act like that? If you want my respect. STOP SHOOTING AND BEATING THE CITIZENS YOU SWORE TO PROTECT!!! ? IF U AGREE

State Police pulled Philadelphia attorney Rebecca Musarra over for allegedly speeding on October 16. 2015. She refused to answer any questions and they arrested her for obstruction of justice. She was later released without being charged for obstruct. Americans have rights and one of them is the right to remain silent. We don't have to answer your stupid interrogation questions. If we are speeding. tell us we were stopped for speeding. issue the warning/summons and get the hell out of our lives Nazis. Why did they escalate the situation? What for? The best part of the video is when they say she had the right to remain silent. LOL!#Copslogic

Please take a moment to read my story! Back in 2015. Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the ground near the vehicle'sfront passenger door belonged to him. Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground. outside of the vehicle. on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his. the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest. and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car. and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys? Damn. after all that. the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO POLICE! The following video is a prime example of why...

Cops are allergic to cameras. they don't like being recorded because it won't allow them to break the law and lie about the circumstances which presented them the opportunity to break the law. ?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school. a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union. of which the alleged victim. Brian Burney. the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student. who recorded the incident. was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer. who is twice the size of Burney. on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover. don't you think it's a bit strange. when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously. police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also. is not destruction of evidence a crime? What do you think about it guys? Please. share or comment below.

Watch below an attack on another victim of police brutality. R.I.P Sarah Reed.

Clark Dickson. a veteran Seattle police department officer. punched a homeless 21-year-old man in the head and remained unpunished. The cop said that his misconduct was "justified" because the man had spit at him. Almost one year after the incident. the footage showing the punch was released. Personally. I didn't notice in the video the suspect spitting at Dickson. However; the police department didn't consider it necessary to punish the cop. The only penalty he got was a suspension without pay for 1 day. Is it really enough for excessive force use?

Did you see this? Damn... We lost count of how many mentally ill citizens were murdered during encounters with violent cops. Here is another woman suffering from mental illness. Full story: http://bit.ly/lOrglhk

A simple traffic stop turned into the violent situation. Cop refused to identify himself. instead. he nearly killed a man. The shocking video reveals the real face of the US police. Read the full story: http://bit.ly/294CSi9

Warning! The video is graphic. Two cops brutally assaulted a man and killed him: Whatever he did. they didn't have the right to treat him like that! Cops are taking away people's lives and they don't even need a reason for that!
