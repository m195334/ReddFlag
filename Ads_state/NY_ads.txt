America has always been hinged on hard-working people. If you remove jobs. you'll remove our country from the world map. The state of Pennsylvania rose owing to multiple enterprises mining coal. producing steel. and creating the need for other jobs. groceries. doctors. dentists. insurance. gas. vehicles. mechanics and the list goes on. As far as Mr. Trump pursues the goal of creating more jobs and supports the working class. He said he would put miners back to work. We could help Mr. Trump win Pennsylvania which is a battleground state. We'd like to organize a rally "Miners for Trump" in Pennsylvania. Have something against coal industries? Please note then that burning coal is not more harmful than lumber. Alternative energy is only possible when subsidized by government for it is not lucrative. You cannot leave tens of thousands of people without a job just because of lobbyists' interests. The current list of locations is being elaborated. Suggested cities are Erie. Pittsburg. Scranton. Harrisburg. Allentown. and Philly. Confirmed locations: Marconi Plaza. Philadelphia. Miners for Trump: Unity day in Pennsylvania

Clinton said the United States needs to confront the 'systematic racism' in its law enforcement efforts. We're sick of politicians organizing and leading the systematical propaganda against our police. It is unfair and vilely to accuse our heroes of every sin and crime. In fact. the efficiency of our cops resulted in a decrease of the average amount of crimes. especially in large cities. Law-abiding citizens should never fear cops. but criminals do. And that's why Hillary is on the criminals' side. Join our rally on July. 23th in New York City. it's time to show Clinton that we will never let her become our next President!

Syrian refugees are not even trying to be modest and grateful for our help. They are bluntly invading western world and demanding upmost respect for their religion. while completely disrespecting and disregarding western values. They are not victims of war; they are the war itself. We need to protect ourselves from this menace by deporting all the refugees we have and refusing to take any more of them.

Illegal immigrant invasion is going at full speed and drug cartels are their most powerful weapon. Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over the course of the investigation. authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth. eight pounds of marijuana. 49.3 grams of heroin. four handguns and $2.5 million in cash. according to a press release. "It would be safe to say that the money would be taken back to Mexico. and that's where the source of the cocaine was." special agent Tim Stone said. This is good news. but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands. which makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to prevent drug influx. but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The most part of this poison comes through southern border. but it is still as unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as they can. At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth. our government officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation. Only a huge wall with gun towers will stop this invasion. Trump is our only hope for a better future!

Police kill us for not moving fast enough. for minding our own business. They don't realize that our daily goal is to return to our families alive and well.

Please share this disturbing video. A routine revenue collection stop turned into a nightmare for this black man. Kevin Campbell was driving his wife's minivan home in June when he was targeted for revenue collection by Allen Park Police Officer Daniel Mack. Mack literally kidnapped Campbell. placed him in handcuffs. threw him in a cage over a suspended license. accused Campbell of having drugs on him despite the fact that the K9 didn't find anything. Moreover. the cop sodomized him by putting the illegal substance inside his body. There was no search warrant.

The choosing of the President must be left to the popular vote. Trump won the Electoral College but is behind by nearly 840.000 votes nationally! This is just wrong! The Electoral College is an outdated. undemocratic system that does not reflect our modern society. and it needs to be changed immediately. Every American should be guaranteed that their vote counts. California Sen. Boxer has recently filed a long-shot bill to abolish the Electoral College which undoubtedly does NOT represent the true voice of US. New York Against KKK

So let's do this. Since no one knew what he looked like and the bible forbade idolatry how about we all stop trying to draw Jesus!

If you also think that there should only be peace. come with us and let's make it happen. Stop war! Stop killing the innocent! Some believed Trump would withdraw the U.S. from useless and bloody military campaigns. But what we see is only the enhancement of hostility. We don't need wars no more! We want peace! It's time for politicians to take care of the U.S. residents instead of fating them. as well as other nationals. to death. We're organizing a peaceful gathering to draw public attention to the above- mentioned terrible problem. Our President and Congress must listen to those who granted them power - us. the people. If you also think that there should only be peace. come with us and let's make it happen. Stop war! Stop killing the innocent! Make peace. not war! Make peace. not war!
