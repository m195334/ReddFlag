On October 15. 1966. Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton have founded BPP. Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change. we must take action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge police brutality in Oakland. California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately. the government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party "the greatest threat to the internal security of the country". They tried to close it. to incarcerate BPP's participants. and in 1982 the original party was dissolved. 50 years have passed since BBP's foundation. but the situation in the country stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We need a strong hand that can protect us. that can keep our people safe. that can make Black Lives really matter. Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their ideas and ideals! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary

Houstonians. come out to honor the memory of Huey P. Newton. and other black leaders and prominent members of the Black Panther Party on October 15! We should revive their legacy and discuss the plan that Newton and Seale crafted to empower Black communities economically. The plan contained basic demands such as self-determination; decent housing; full employment. education that included African-American history; and an end to police brutality. The list of confirmed speakers will be released a few days before the event. Share and invite your friends! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary H-Town

January 15 marks the birthday of Martin Luther King. Jr.. a great man who spent his public career working toward ending segregation and fighting racial discrimination. By recalling King's vision we can have opportunities to build a more inclusive and just community that does not retreat from diversity but draws strength from it. In the face of violence directed at minority communities and in a deepening political divisions in the country. King's words and philosophy are perhaps more critical for us today than at any point in the recent past. We're coming together on January 15 to celebrate the life and achievements one of the most influential American civil rights leaders. Don't forget to bring your children with you. because it's important for them to know where they come from and their rich history. Join us on January 15! Let's keep the dream alive!
